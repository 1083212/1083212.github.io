    <p>I have been playing chess for 8 years now. I started playing when I was 6 years old with my grandparents.</p>
    <p>I have gone to many tournaments and I like to play the Italian opening with the Giuoco Piano line.</p>
    <p>I don't play that often anymore but I still like to play online on chess.com or lichess.</p>
