    <p>Table tennis is a hobby of mine that I have discovered very recently, in the summer of 24-25.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, it is very fun to play and I learn mostly through youtube videos.</p>
    <p>To play, I go to the YMCA because they have a table tennis court there and play with my friends or family</p>
